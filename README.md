# Age-related traits

This is a repository for age-related disease (ARD) and trait (ART) set.



## Introduction

## Summary statistics

This resources collectively includes 623 ARDs and ARTs mapped with 365 MeSH terms. Below 15 traits were excluded from the original list, because 8 traits from Chang 2019 and 7 traits from Donertas 2020 were irrelevant (e.g., 2 congenital diseases, 8 injuries, and a trauma) or unclear (5 traits).
